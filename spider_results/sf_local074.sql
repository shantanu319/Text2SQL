To achieve the desired summary of closing balances, monthly changes, and monthly cumulative bank account balances for each customer, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
WITH MonthlyBalances AS (
    SELECT 
        CustomerID,
        DATE_TRUNC('month', TransactionDate) AS Month,
        SUM(TransactionAmount) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID ORDER BY TransactionDate ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS CumulativeBalance,
        SUM(CASE WHEN TransactionType = 'Deposit' THEN TransactionAmount ELSE -TransactionAmount END) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID ORDER BY TransactionDate ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS CurrentMonthBalance
    FROM 
        Transactions
),
MonthlyChanges AS (
    SELECT 
        CustomerID,
        Month,
        CurrentMonthBalance - LAG(CurrentMonthBalance) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID ORDER BY Month) AS MonthlyChange
    FROM 
        MonthlyBalances
)
SELECT 
    CustomerID,
    Month,
    CurrentMonthBalance,
    MonthlyChange,
    CumulativeBalance
FROM 
    MonthlyChanges
ORDER BY 
    CustomerID, Month;
```
