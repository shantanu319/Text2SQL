This SQL query calculates the required summary statistics for genetic variants within the specified genomic region using the gnomAD v3 dataset. It counts the number of unique variants, totals the allele counts, and identifies distinct gene symbols through the use of Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) annotations. The mutation density is computed by dividing the length of the region by the number of variants found within that range. Ensure that the `variant_id`, `allele_count`, `total_alleles`, and `gene_symbol` columns exist in your database schema corresponding to these fields in the gnomAD v3 dataset. Adjust the column names if they differ in your specific database schema.
