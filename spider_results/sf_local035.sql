To convert the given text into an SQL query, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the relevant columns**: The columns `geolocation_state`, `geolocation_city`, `geolocation_zip_code_prefix`, `geolocation_lat`, and `geolocation_lng` are used to determine the order of cities.

2. **Calculate the distance between consecutive cities**: We can use the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere (like Earth). However, for simplicity, let's assume we have a function `distance(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2)` that returns the distance between two points.

3. **Order the cities**: Order the cities by the specified columns.

4. **Find the pair with the greatest distance**: Iterate through the ordered list and calculate the distance between each consecutive pair of cities. Keep track of the maximum distance and the corresponding pair of cities.

Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:

```sql
WITH OrderedCities AS (
    SELECT 
        geolocation_state,
        geolocation_city,
        geolocation_zip_code_prefix,
        geolocation_lat,
        geolocation_lng,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY 
            geolocation_state, 
            geolocation_city,
