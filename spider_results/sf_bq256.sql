To convert the given text into an SQL query, we need to break down the requirements and translate them into a structured database query. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the Relevant Tables**: We need tables that store transaction details, such as `transactions`, `addresses`, and possibly `blocks` for block information.

2. **Filter Transactions**: We need to filter transactions based on the following criteria:
   - The transaction was successful.
   - The transaction occurred before September 1, 2021 (UTC).
   - The transaction is not a delegatecall, callcode, or staticcall.
   - The transaction includes all relevant incoming and outgoing transfers, miner rewards, and gas fee deductions.

3. **Calculate the Final Balance**: For each address, calculate the final balance by summing up all relevant transactions.

4. **Determine the Address with the Highest Number of Successful Transactions**: Identify the address that has initiated the highest number of successful transactions.

5. **Convert the Balance to Ether**: Convert the calculated balance from the native unit to Ether.

Here's the SQL query that implements these steps:

```sql
WITH TransactionDetails AS (
    SELECT 
        t.transaction_id,
        t.address_id,
        t.amount,
        t
