This SQL query retrieves information about the hurricane with the third longest total travel distance in the North Atlantic during 2020. It joins multiple tables to gather data on the hurricane's name, travel coordinates, cumulative travel distance, and maximum sustained wind speed. The results are ordered by the total travel distance in descending order and limited to the top result. Adjustments may be needed based on the actual table structure and column names used in your database.
