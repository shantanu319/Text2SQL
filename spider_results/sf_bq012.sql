This SQL query calculates the average balance in quadrillions for the top 10 Ethereum addresses based on their net balance, including incoming and outgoing transfers from traces, miner rewards, and sender gas fee deductions. It excludes null addresses and rounds the result to two decimal places. The `traces` table is assumed to contain relevant transaction data, with columns such as `address`, `type`, `amount`, `gas_fee`, and `sender_gas_fee_deduction`. Adjust the table and column names as necessary to fit your actual database schema
