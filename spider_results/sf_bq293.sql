To convert the given text into an SQL query, we need to break down the requirements and construct a query that performs the specified operations. Here's how you can achieve this:

```sql
WITH TripData AS (
    SELECT 
        t.TripID,
        t.ZIPCode,
        t.HourOfDay,
        t.Latitude,
        t.Longitude,
        t.Timestamp
    FROM 
        YellowTaxiTrips t
    WHERE 
        t.Year = 2015 AND t.Month = 1
),
ZipCodeBoundaries AS (
    SELECT 
        z.ZipCode,
        b.BoundaryName
    FROM 
        ZipCodes z
    JOIN 
        ZipCodeBoundaries b ON z.ZipCode = b.ZipCode
),
JoinedData AS (
    SELECT 
        td.TripID,
        td.ZIPCode,
        td.HourOfDay,
        td.Latitude,
        td.Longitude,
        td.Timestamp,
        zb.BoundaryName
    FROM 
        TripData td
    LEFT JOIN 
        ZipCodeBoundaries zb ON td.ZIPCode = zb.ZipCode
),
LaggedTripCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        td.ZIPCode,
        td.HourOfDay,
        COUNT(td.TripID) AS
