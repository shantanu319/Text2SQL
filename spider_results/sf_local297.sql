To convert the given text into SQL, we need to break down the task into several steps and write corresponding SQL queries for each step. Here's how you can structure the SQL:

```sql
-- Step 1: Group deposits and withdrawals by the first day of each month
WITH MonthlyTransactions AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        DATE_TRUNC('month', transaction_date) AS transaction_month,
        SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'deposit' THEN amount ELSE -amount END) AS net_amount
    FROM 
        transactions
    GROUP BY 
        customer_id, transaction_month
)

-- Step 2: Calculate each month's closing balance
WITH CumulativeBalances AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        transaction_month,
        net_amount,
        SUM(net_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_month) AS cumulative_balance
    FROM 
        MonthlyTransactions
)

-- Step 3: Determine the most recent month's growth rate
WITH GrowthRates AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        transaction_month,
        cumulative_balance,
        LAG(cumulative_balance) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_month) AS prev_cumulative_balance
    FROM 
        CumulativeBalances
)
