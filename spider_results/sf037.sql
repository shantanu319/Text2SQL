To calculate the shortest straight-line distance in miles between each 'The Home Depot' store and its nearest 'Lowe's Home Improvement' store using geographic coordinates, you can use the Haversine formula. This formula is commonly used to calculate the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes.

Here's an example SQL query that calculates the minimal distance for each 'The Home Depot' location:

```sql
WITH TheHomeDepot AS (
    SELECT 
        poi_id,
        latitude AS hd_latitude,
        longitude AS hd_longitude
    FROM 
        stores
    WHERE 
        store_type = 'The Home Depot'
),
LowesHomeImprovement AS (
    SELECT 
        poi_id,
        latitude AS lw_latitude,
        longitude AS lw_longitude
    FROM 
        stores
    WHERE 
        store_type = 'Lowe's Home Improvement'
)
SELECT 
    td.poi_id,
    MIN(
        6371 * acos(
            cos(radians(td.hd_latitude)) * cos(radians(lw.lw_latitude))
            * cos(radians(td.hd_longitude) - radians(lw.lw_longitude))
            + sin(radians(td.hd_latitude)) * sin(radians(lw.lw_latitude))
        )
