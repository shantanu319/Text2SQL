```sql
SELECT L1_model, COUNT(*) AS occurrence_count
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT L1_model
    FROM your_table_name
    WHERE model_type = 'Traditional' OR model_type = 'Stack'
) AS filtered_models
GROUP BY L1_model
ORDER BY occurrence_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Replace `your_table_name` with the actual name of your table. This query filters out the distinct model categories for both traditional and stack models, counts their occurrences, and then orders them by frequency in descending order to find the most frequent one. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the top result is returned. Adjust the column names as necessary based on your database schema.
