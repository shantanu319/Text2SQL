Make sure to replace `your_table_name` and `your_clinical_data_table` with the actual table names used in your database. Also, adjust the column names (`participant_barcode`, `gene`, `lgg`, `normalized_count`) if they are different in your schema. Additionally, ensure that the `log10` function is available in your SQL dialect. If not, you might need to use a library or function provided by your database system. For example, in PostgreSQL, you can use `LOG(10, normalized_count + 1)` instead of `log10`. In MySQL, you would use `LOG10(normalized
