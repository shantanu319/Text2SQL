This query first identifies the highest release version for each NPM package using a subquery. It then joins this information with the `npm_dependencies` table to get all dependencies for those packages. Finally, it groups by the package name and version, counts the occurrences, orders them in descending order based on frequency, and limits the result to the top occurrence.
