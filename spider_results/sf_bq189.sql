To convert the given text into SQL, we need to break down the task into several steps and write corresponding SQL queries. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate the Average Monthly Percentage Growth Rate in Unique Orders:**
   - For each product category, compare the number of unique orders in each month to the previous month.
   - Calculate the percentage growth rate for each month.

2. **Identify the Product Category with the Highest Average Order Growth Rate:**
   - Aggregate the average order growth rates for each product category.
   - Determine which product category has the highest average order growth rate.

3. **Compute the Average Monthly Revenue Growth Rate:**
   - Calculate the percentage change in total revenue from month to month.
   - Average these values over the entire period for the identified product category.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH MonthlyUniqueOrders AS (
    SELECT 
        product_category,
        DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month,
        COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS unique_orders
    FROM 
        orders
    GROUP BY 
        product_category, DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
),
MonthlyRevenueGrowth AS (
    SELECT 
        product_category,
        DATE_TRUNC('month', order
