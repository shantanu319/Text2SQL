To achieve the task described, you can use a combination of SQL queries to first calculate the average distance for each unique city pair and then distribute these pairs into the specified distance ranges. Finally, you can determine the number of pairs in the distance range with the fewest unique city pairs. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Average Distance**: First, calculate the average distance for each unique city pair.

2. **Distribute Pairs into Ranges**: Use the calculated average distances to distribute the city pairs into the specified ranges.

3. **Count Unique City Pairs in Each Range**: Count the number of unique city pairs in each range.

4. **Find the Fewest Unique City Pairs**: Identify the range with the fewest unique city pairs.

Here's the SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
WITH Distances AS (
    SELECT 
        c1.city_id AS city1,
        c2.city_id AS city2,
        AVG(r.distance) AS avg_distance
    FROM 
        cities c1
    JOIN 
        cities c2 ON c1.city_id < c2.city_id
    JOIN 
        routes r ON (r.city1 = c1.city_id AND r.city2 = c2.city_id) OR
