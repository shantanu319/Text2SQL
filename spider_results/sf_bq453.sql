```

This SQL query selects the required information from a table named `variants` where the chromosome is '17' and the position falls within the specified range. The result will include the reference name, start and end positions, reference bases, distinct alternate bases, variant type, chi-squared score, total number of genotypes, and the observed and expected counts for homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, as well as allele frequencies from 1KG. Adjust the table and column names according to your actual database schema.
