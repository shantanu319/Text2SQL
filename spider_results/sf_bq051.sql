To calculate the average daily number of Citibike trips in New York City during 2016, categorized as rainy or non-rainy based on precipitation, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes you have two tables: `citibike_trips` and `ghcn_data`. The `citibike_trips` table contains information about Citibike trips, including the date, and the `ghcn_data` table contains weather data for the GHCN stations.

```sql
WITH RainyDays AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE(trip_date) AS trip_day,
        AVG(CASE WHEN precipitation > 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS is_rainy
    FROM 
        citibike_trips
    WHERE 
        YEAR(trip_date) = 2016
    GROUP BY 
        DATE(trip_date)
),
WeatherData AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE(wd_date) AS wd_day,
        ghcn_station_id,
        precipitation
    FROM 
        ghcn_data
    WHERE 
        ST_Distance(
            POINT(40.7128, -74.0060),
            ST_GeomFromText('POINT(longitude latitude
