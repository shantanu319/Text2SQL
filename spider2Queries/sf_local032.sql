Certainly! To achieve this, we need to write a SQL query that retrieves the required information from your database. Assuming you have tables named `orders`, `customers`, `products`, and `ratings`, here's how you can construct the query:

```sql
SELECT 
    s.seller_id,
    s.seller_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) AS num_distinct_customers,
    SUM(p.price * o.quantity) AS total_profit,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS num_distinct_orders,
    AVG(r.rating) AS avg_5_star_ratings
FROM 
    orders o
JOIN 
    customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN 
    products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN 
    ratings r ON o.order_id = r.order_id
JOIN 
    sellers s ON o.seller_id = s.seller_id
WHERE 
    o.status = 'delivered'
GROUP BY 
    s.seller_id, s.seller_name
ORDER BY 
    num_distinct_customers DESC,
    total_profit DESC,
    num_distinct_orders DESC,
    avg_5_star_ratings DESC;
```
