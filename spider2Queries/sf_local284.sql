To generate a summary of the loss rates for your veg wholesale data, you can use the following SQL query. This query calculates the average loss rate and then breaks down the count of items into those below, above, and within one standard deviation from this average.

```sql
SELECT 
    AVG(loss_rate) AS average_loss_rate,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN loss_rate < average_loss_rate THEN 1 END) AS below_average_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN loss_rate > average_loss_rate THEN 1 END) AS above_average_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN loss_rate BETWEEN average_loss_rate - STDDEV(loss_rate) AND average_loss_rate + STDDEV(loss_rate) THEN 1 END) AS within_one_stddev_count
FROM 
    veg_wholesale_data;
```

### Explanation:
- **AVG(loss_rate)**: Calculates the average loss rate.
- **COUNT(CASE WHEN loss_rate < average_loss_rate THEN 1 END)**: Counts the number of items with a loss rate below the average.
- **COUNT(CASE WHEN loss_rate > average_loss_rate THEN 1 END)**: Counts the number of items with a loss rate above the average.
- **COUNT(CASE WHEN loss_rate BETWEEN average_loss_rate - STDDEV(loss_rate) AND
