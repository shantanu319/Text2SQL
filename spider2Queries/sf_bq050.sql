To achieve the desired analysis using SQL, you can follow these steps:

1. **Join Trip Data with Weather Information**: Use a common column like `trip_id` or `bike_trip_id` to link trip data with weather information.
2. **Map Locations to Neighborhoods**: Use the `zip_codes` table to map trip locations to borough and neighborhood names.
3. **Group Data by Starting and Ending Neighborhoods**: Aggregate the data to get the required statistics.

Here's an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
WITH CombinedData AS (
    SELECT 
        t.trip_id,
        t.start_zip_code,
        t.end_zip_code,
        w.temperature,
        w.wind_speed,
        w.precipitation,
        DATE(w.timestamp) AS trip_date,
        CASE WHEN w.station_name = 'Central Park' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS central_park_station
    FROM 
        cyclistic t
    JOIN 
        geo_us_boundaries gb ON t.start_zip_code = gb.zip_code
    LEFT JOIN 
        weather_data w ON t.trip_date = w.timestamp AND w.station_name = 'Central Park'
),
TripDetails AS (
    SELECT 
        cd.start_zip_code,
        cd.end_zip_code,
        COUNT(cd
