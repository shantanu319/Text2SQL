```sql
SELECT 
    AVG(log10(HTSeq__Counts + 1)) AS avg_rna_seq_expression,
    COUNT(DISTINCT miRNA_id) AS num_unique_mirnas
FROM 
    TCGA_BRCA
WHERE 
    age <= 80 AND 
    pathologic_stage IN ('Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage IIA')
GROUP BY 
    patient_id;
```

This query calculates the average log10-transformed RNA-Seq expression levels for each patient in the specified cohort and counts the number of unique microRNAs expressed by those patients.

To calculate the t-statistic derived from the Pearson correlation between the log10-transformed average RNA-Seq expression levels of SNORA31 and the average microRNA-Seq expression levels of all unique microRNAs, you would need additional steps:

1. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two variables.
2. Determine the degrees of freedom.
3. Use the t-distribution to calculate the t-statistic.

Here's an example of how you might do this using Python and pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df is your DataFrame containing the calculated values
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'avg_rna_seq_expression
