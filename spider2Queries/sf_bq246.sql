This SQL query retrieves U.S. patents that meet the specified criteria for backward and forward citations within the given time frames. It uses `LEFT JOIN` to count the number of forward and backward citations for each patent and filters based on the country being 'US'. The `HAVING` clause ensures that only patents with both types of citations are considered. The
