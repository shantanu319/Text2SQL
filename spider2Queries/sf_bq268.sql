This query calculates the longest period between the first visit and the last recorded event (either the last visit or the first transaction) for each user who has a mobile device as their last recorded event. It uses subqueries to find the first and last visit dates for each user and then joins these results with the main table to filter by mobile devices. Finally, it groups the results by user ID to
