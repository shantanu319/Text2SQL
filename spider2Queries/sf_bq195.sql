This query calculates the total balance for each Ethereum address by summing up the `value` and `gas_fee` of all transactions from that address. It filters out unsuccessful transactions and only considers calls to the Ethereum contract. The results are ordered by the total balance in descending order and limited to the top 10 addresses. Adjust the `to_address` if you're using a different Ethereum contract address. Also, ensure that the `timestamp` column is correctly formatted in your database schema. If it's stored as a string, you might need
