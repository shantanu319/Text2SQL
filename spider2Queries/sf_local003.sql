To convert the given text into SQL, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Tables**: We assume there are tables named `orders`, `customers`, and possibly a join table if `orders` and `customers` are not directly related.

2. **Define the Criteria**:
   - **Recency**: Calculate the recency as the difference between the current date and the latest purchase timestamp.
   - **Frequency**: Count the number of orders per customer.
   - **Monetary Value**: Sum up the total spend per customer.

3. **Classify RFM Segments**:
   - Define thresholds for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value to classify customers into segments.

4. **Calculate Average Sales**:
   - Compute the average sales per order for each customer within distinct RFM segments.

5. **Report Differences**:
   - Analyze and report the differences in average sales across the RFM segments.

Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:

```sql
WITH RFM_Segments AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_unique_identifier,
        o.latest_purchase_timestamp,
        COUNT(o.order_id) AS frequency,
        SUM(o.total_spend) AS monetary_value,
        DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), o
