To generate the required monthly analysis report for e-commerce sales, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
WITH MonthlySales AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) AS sale_month,
        product_category,
        COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders,
        SUM(sale_amount) AS total_revenue,
        SUM(sale_amount - cost_price) AS total_profit
    FROM 
        sales_data
    WHERE 
        sale_date BETWEEN '2019-06-01' AND '2019-12-31'
    GROUP BY 
        DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date), product_category
),
GrowthRates AS (
    SELECT 
        ms.sale_month,
        ms.product_category,
        ms.total_orders,
        ms.total_revenue,
        ms.total_profit,
        COALESCE(
            (ms.total_orders / prev_ms.total_orders) * 100,
            NULL
        ) AS orders_growth_rate,
        COALESCE(
            (ms.total_revenue / prev_ms.total_revenue) * 100,
            NULL
        ) AS revenue_growth_rate,
        COALESCE(
            (ms.total_profit / prev_ms.total_profit) * 1
