```sql
SELECT 
    session_id,
    path,
    search_type
FROM 
    events
WHERE 
    event_type IN ('/detail', '/complete')
    AND search_type IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    session_id, 
    event_time ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query identifies the sessions with the minimal number of events occurring before the first '/detail' click or '/complete' conversion within the session, considering only events with non-empty search types. It then displays the associated paths and search types for each session. Note that this is a simplified version and assumes that there is at least one event in each session. You may need to adjust the logic based on your specific requirements.
