To convert the given text into an SQL query, we need to break down the requirements and translate them into a structured SQL statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the Product IDs, Aisles, and Positions**: We need to retrieve these details from the `product` table.

2. **Calculate the Quantities to Be Picked**: We need to calculate the quantities based on the order lines and ensure they match the cumulative quantities ordered without exceeding the available inventory in warehouse 1.

3. **Prioritize Inventory**: We need to prioritize inventory with earlier purchased dates and smaller quantities.

4. **Respect Order Sequence and Cumulative Quantities**: We need to ensure that picking respects the sequence and cumulative quantities of the order lines for products with multiple entries.

Here's the SQL query that accomplishes these tasks:

```sql
WITH OrderedProducts AS (
    SELECT 
        ol.order_id,
        ol.product_id,
        ol.quantity_ordered,
        p.aisle,
        p.position,
        p.inventory_quantity,
        p.purchase_date
    FROM 
        order_line ol
    JOIN 
        product p ON ol.product_id = p.product_id
),
PickingPlan AS (
    SELECT 
        op.order_id,
        op.product
