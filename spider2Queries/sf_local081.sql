To convert the given text into SQL, we need to break down the task into several steps:

1. **Identify the relevant tables**: We assume we have at least three tables:
   - `Customers`: Contains customer information.
   - `Orders`: Contains order details including order date, customer ID, and product quantities.
   - `Products`: Contains product information including unit prices.

2. **Filter orders from 1998**: We need to filter the orders to include only those placed in 1998.

3. **Calculate total amount spent by each customer**: For each customer, we need to sum the unit price multiplied by the quantity of all products in their orders.

4. **Assign customers to spending groups**: Based on predefined thresholds, assign each customer to a spending group.

5. **Count and calculate percentages for each spending group**: Determine the number of customers in each group and calculate the percentage of the total number of customers who placed orders in 1998 each group represents.

Here's the SQL query that accomplishes these tasks:

```sql
WITH FilteredOrders AS (
    SELECT 
        o.CustomerID,
        SUM(p.UnitPrice * o.Quantity) AS TotalAmountSpent
    FROM 
        Orders o
