This SQL query identifies cytoband names on chromosome 1 in the TCGA-KIRC segment allelic dataset where the frequency of amplifications, gains, and heterozygous deletions each ranks within the top 11. The rankings are calculated based on the maximum copy number observed across various genomic studies of kidney cancer, reflecting the severity of genetic alterations. The results are ordered by the frequencies of amplifications, gains, and heterozygous deletions in descending order.
