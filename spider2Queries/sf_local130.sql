```sql
SELECT 
    student_last_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY student_last_name) = 1 THEN 'Top'
        ELSE PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY grade) OVER (PARTITION BY student_last_name)
    END AS quintile_rank
FROM 
    students
WHERE 
    course_name = 'English';
```

This query selects the last name of each student who has completed an English course and calculates their quintile rank based on their individual grades. The `PERCENTILE_CONT` function is used to determine the quartile rank, which is then categorized as "Top" if there is only one student with that last name. Otherwise, it uses the percentile method to calculate the rank. The results are filtered to include only students who have taken the English course.
