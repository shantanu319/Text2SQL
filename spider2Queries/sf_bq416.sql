This SQL query retrieves the top three largest USDT transfers from the TRON blockchain based on the specified criteria. It filters transactions by the USDT contract address and the transfer event signature, converts the raw transfer value to USDT by dividing by 1,000,000, and orders the results by the largest transferred amounts in descending order.
