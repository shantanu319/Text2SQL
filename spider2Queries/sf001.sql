This SQL query retrieves the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year. It filters the data based on the specified conditions and formats the date output as `YYYY-MM-DD`. The `postal_code` column is selected from the `snowfall_data` table, and the `date` and `snowfall_amount` columns are formatted accordingly. The subquery ensures that only records within the specified date range are considered. The final result includes the postal code, formatted date, and snowfall amount. <im
