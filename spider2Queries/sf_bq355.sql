```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN medication NOT LIKE '%quinapril%' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) * 100 / COUNT(*) AS non_quinapril_percentage
FROM 
    participants;
```

This SQL query calculates the percentage of participants who are not using quinapril or any related medications. It uses a `CASE` statement within the `COUNT` function to count the number of participants who do not have "quinapril" in their medication list, then divides this by the total number of participants to get the percentage. The result is multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage format. Replace `participants` with the actual table name that contains your participant data. Also, ensure that the column name for medication information matches the one used in your database schema. If you need to filter based on a specific CUI (Concept Unique Identifier), you can add a condition like `WHERE medication LIKE '%quinapril%' AND medication LIKE '%RxCUI:35208%'`. Adjust the column names and conditions as necessary to fit your specific database schema.
