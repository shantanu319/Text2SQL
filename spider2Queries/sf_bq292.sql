To convert the given text into an SQL query, we need to break down the requirements and construct a query that retrieves the necessary data. Here's how you can structure the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', transaction_date) AS month,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN tx_type = 'CoinJoin' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS coinjoin_transactions,
    AVG(input_value / output_value) AS avg_coinjoin_input_output_ratio,
    SUM(input_value) AS total_coinjoin_volume
FROM 
    bitcoin_transactions
WHERE 
    transaction_date >= '2023-07-01'
GROUP BY 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', transaction_date)
ORDER BY 
    month;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Data Source**: The query assumes that the `bitcoin_transactions` table contains relevant columns such as `transaction_date`, `tx_type`, `input_value`, and `output_value`.

2. **Date Truncation**: We use `DATE_TRUNC('month', transaction_date)` to group the data by month.

3. **Counting CoinJoins**:
   - We use a `CASE` statement within `COUNT` to count only those transactions where `tx_type` is 'CoinJoin'.
