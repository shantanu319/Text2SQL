To achieve the desired result using SQL, you can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Trip Durations**: First, determine the duration of each trip in minutes.
2. **Round Trip Durations**: Round the trip durations to the nearest minute.
3. **Create Quantile Groups**: Divide the trips into ten equal quantile groups based on the rounded minute durations.
4. **Calculate Total Trips and Average Fare**: For each quantile group, calculate the total number of trips and the average fare.
5. **Format Time Ranges**: Display each group's formatted time range (XXm to XXm).
6. **Sort Chronologically**: Sort the results chronologically.

Here is a sample SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
WITH TripDurations AS (
    SELECT 
        trip_id,
        trip_duration,
        ROUND(trip_duration / 60) AS rounded_minute_duration
    FROM 
        taxi_trips
),
Quantiles AS (
    SELECT 
        trip_id,
        trip_duration,
        rounded_minute_duration,
        NTILE(10) OVER (ORDER BY rounded_minute_duration) AS quantile_group
    FROM 
        TripDurations
)
SELECT 
    q.quantile_group,
    MIN(q.rounded_minute_duration
