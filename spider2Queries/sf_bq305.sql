```sql
SELECT u.user_id, u.username, SUM(q.view_count) AS total_view_count
FROM users u
JOIN questions q ON u.user_id = q.owner_user_id
LEFT JOIN answers a ON q.question_id = a.question_id
WHERE (
    a.accepted_answer = TRUE
    OR a.score > 5
    OR a.score > 0.2 * SUM(a.score) OVER (PARTITION BY q.question_id)
    OR a.answer_score_rank <= 3
)
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.username
ORDER BY total_view_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query calculates the total view count for each user who meets the specified conditions and then orders the results by the total view count in descending order to find the users with the highest combined view counts. The `LIMIT 10` clause ensures that only the top 10 users are returned. Note that the `answer_score_rank` calculation assumes that there is a column named `answer_score_rank` in the `answers` table that ranks answers within each question based on their scores. If such a column does not exist, you may need to calculate it separately using window functions or additional logic. Additionally, ensure that the database schema matches the assumptions made
